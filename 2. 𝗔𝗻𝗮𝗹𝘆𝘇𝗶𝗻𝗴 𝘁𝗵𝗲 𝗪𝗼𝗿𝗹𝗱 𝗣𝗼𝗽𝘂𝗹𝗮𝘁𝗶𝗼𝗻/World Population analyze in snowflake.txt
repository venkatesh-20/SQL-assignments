𝗔𝗽𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗮𝗰𝗵/𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗜𝗱𝗲𝗮 You will learn how to use SQL to answer the following analytical questions: 
1. Which country has the highest population? 
2. Which country has the least number of people? 
3. Which country is witnessing the highest population growth? 
4. Which country has an extraordinary number for the population? 
5. Which is the most densely populated country in the world?
